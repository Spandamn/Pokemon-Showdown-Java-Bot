# Pokemon-Showdown-Java-Bot
Bot for [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/). Put your login details etc in details.json.

# Does it fuckin work
Yes. I'll need to add more commands, make it more Bot-y, handle more exceptions etc.
It uses [TooTallNate's Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/) to connect to PS.

# How do I use it
This bot requires Java. I was using Java 8 i think.
Use `javac Main.java` to compile it, then `java Main` to run.
